# Exercise C2-4-6

## Files to work in:

- `basic_loop.py`
- `lesson-2-object-detection/exercises/starter/l2_exercises.py`

Implement `plot_precision_recall()`. Note that you may need to do additional work to determine precision and recall values at the different confidence thresholds from the pre-computed results.

## Running the Code

As usual, run `python basic_loop.py` from the terminal within the `nd013-c2-fusion-exercises` directory when you have implemented your code.
